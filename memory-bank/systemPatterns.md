# System Patterns: Spark

## Architecture Overview

Spark follows a modern web application architecture with clearly separated concerns:

1. **Frontend Layer**: Next.js applications (web and docs) providing the user interface
2. **Component Library**: Shared UI components for consistency across applications
3. **Backend Services**: Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
4. **API Layer**: Combination of Next.js API routes and Supabase REST/GraphQL endpoints
5. **External Integrations**: Connections to social media platforms and AI services

The system uses a monorepo structure managed by Turborepo to share code and configurations across applications while maintaining separation of concerns.

## Design Patterns

- **Component-Based Architecture**: UI broken down into reusable components
- **Server Components & Client Components**: Using Next.js App Router pattern for optimal rendering strategy
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction over data sources
- **Provider Pattern**: Context providers for shared state
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable strategies for different social media platforms
- **Factory Pattern**: Creating appropriate content types based on platform requirements
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-based system for real-time updates

## Component Relationships

- Web and docs applications consume the shared UI component library
- UI components connect to data providers for state management
- Service layer abstracts interaction with Supabase backend
- Adapter layer handles communication with third-party services
- Analytics components collect and process user interaction data

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Captured through React components
2. **Data Validation**: Performed client-side and server-side
3. **API Processing**: Handled by Next.js API routes or direct Supabase calls
4. **Database Operations**: Executed through Supabase client
5. **External Service Calls**: Managed through adapter interfaces
6. **Response Handling**: Data returned to components for rendering
7. **State Updates**: Managed through React state or context

## Key Interfaces

- **Authentication Interface**: User login, registration, and session management
- **Content Management Interface**: Creating and editing social media content
- **Platform Publishing Interface**: Sending content to social media platforms
- **Analytics Interface**: Reporting on content performance
- **User Management Interface**: Account settings and preferences
- **Team Collaboration Interface**: Shared workflows and approvals

## Technical Decisions

- **Monorepo Structure**: Enables code sharing while maintaining separation of concerns
- **Next.js App Router**: Provides optimal rendering strategies with React Server Components
- **Supabase Backend**: Simplifies authentication, database, and storage with a unified API
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and improves developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides utility-first styling for rapid UI development
- **PNPM**: Efficient package management with disk space optimization

## Performance Considerations

- Server-side rendering for initial page load performance
- Client-side navigation for fast subsequent page transitions
- Image optimization through Next.js image component
- Code splitting for reduced bundle sizes
- Caching strategies for API responses
- Database query optimization
- Lazy loading of non-critical components

## Security Model

- JWT-based authentication through Supabase
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Row-level security in PostgreSQL database
- HTTPS for all connections
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Regular security audits and updates
- Secure handling of API keys and secrets

## Error Handling

- Centralized error logging and monitoring
- Graceful degradation of features during errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Comprehensive error boundaries in React components
- Structured error responses from API endpoints

## Scalability Approach

- Stateless architecture for horizontal scaling
- Edge caching for static content
- Database connection pooling
- Serverless functions that scale automatically
- Efficient resource utilization through code sharing
- Content delivery network for global distribution
- Incremental Static Regeneration for optimized content updates
