# Technical Context: Spark

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:

  - Next.js 15+ with App Router
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Monorepo structure with Turborepo

- **Backend**:

  - Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Serverless functions

- **DevOps & Infrastructure**:

  - Vercel for deployment
  - GitHub for version control
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines

- **Tools & Utilities**:
  - ESLint for code linting
  - Prettier for code formatting
  - PNPM as package manager
  - TypeScript for static type checking

## Development Environment

- Turborepo for monorepo management
- PNPM workspaces for package management
- VSCode as the recommended IDE
- ESLint and Prettier configurations shared across packages
- Shared TypeScript configurations
- Component library shared between applications
- Hot module reloading for rapid development

## Build Process

- PNPM scripts for building and development
- Turborepo for efficient build caching and pipeline management
- Next.js build system for optimized production builds
- Tailwind CSS processing for optimized styles
- TypeScript compilation with shared configuration

## Dependencies

- **UI Components**: Shared UI library with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Data Fetching**: Next.js built-in data fetching capabilities
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Database Access**: Supabase PostgreSQL client
- **Forms & Validation**: To be determined
- **AI Integration**: To be determined

## Technical Constraints

- Browser compatibility requirements (modern browsers)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG standards)
- Performance requirements for social media content generation
- Security considerations for user data and content
- Scalability for multiple simultaneous users

## Testing Strategy

- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Mock service worker for API mocking
- Supabase local development for backend testing
- TypeScript for type safety and preventing common errors

## Deployment Pipeline

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Vercel for frontend deployment
- Supabase for backend deployment
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Database migrations during deployment process
- Rollback capabilities for failed deployments

## Infrastructure

- Vercel for hosting frontend applications
- Supabase for backend services
- PostgreSQL database through Supabase
- Content Delivery Network for assets
- Serverless functions for background processing

## Third-Party Integrations

- Social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)
- AI services for content generation and analysis
- Media processing and optimization services
- Analytics and reporting tools
- Email notification services

## Technical Debt

- Initial setup using boilerplate that may need customization
- Prototype features that will need refinement
- Early architecture decisions that may need revisiting
- Documentation that will need expansion as the project grows
