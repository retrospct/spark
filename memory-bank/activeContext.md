# Active Context: Spark

## Current Focus

The project is in its initialization phase. We are setting up the Memory Bank structure to document the project as it develops. Spark is an AI-powered platform for social media marketing, communications, and branding, built on a Turborepo structure with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.

## Recent Changes

- Created Memory Bank structure
- Initialized core documentation files
- Set up Turborepo with Next.js apps (web and docs) and shared packages
- Established project structure with UI component library

## Next Steps

- Update the project brief with specific requirements and goals
- Detail the technical architecture and dependencies
- Implement database models and migrations
- Begin development of core features
- Set up testing infrastructure

## Active Decisions

- Using a Memory Bank system for comprehensive project documentation
- Following a structured approach to project development
- Using Turborepo for monorepo management
- Adopting Next.js 15+ with App Router for frontend
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implementing Supabase for backend
- Deploying via Vercel
- Using GitHub for version control

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Documentation-first approach
- Clear separation of concerns in documentation and code
- Component-based architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- Shared UI components across applications
- Sequential numbering for database migrations
- Regular updates to reflect current project state

## Project Insights

- The project has a monorepo structure with shared packages
- Web and docs applications share UI components and configurations
- The project follows modern React practices with Next.js App Router
- Database migrations require review before execution
